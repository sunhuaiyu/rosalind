Problem
A submatrix of a matrix M is a matrix formed by selecting rows and columns 
from M and taking only those entries found at the intersections of the selected 
rows and columns. We may also think of a submatrix as formed by deleting 
the remaining rows and columns from M.

Given: An inconsistent character table C on at most 100 taxa.

Return: A submatrix of Câ€² representing a consistent character table on 
the same taxa and formed by deleting a single row of C. 
(If multiple solutions exist, you may return any one.)
